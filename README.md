# CS:GO Chaos Server side
## This was heavily inspired by GTA V Chaos Mod
### This is only the server side, which manages the activation of chaos features, voting through livestream services like Youtube & Twitch & the main UI
### The Client side, which contains the actual features is currently not public for your own safety
### As the Client works the same way as a cheat does, injecting itself to the CS:GO process, it is important that it is safe to inject and use.

### All of this is work in progress.
### An estimate release date for the first beta version open to the public is July 2022
